This proof of concept gathers publicly available (but highly obtuse) data and extracts essential information about bills, laws, votes, and affiliated parties, which can then be presented in a way that is easy to understand and share. This open-source platform runs OCR (optimal character recognition) and NLP (natural language processing) algorithms and hosts the results on a simple website. Updates are automated (with minimal human-in-the-loop involvement) to optimize operations and reduce the reliance on donors or funders. While the framework was created for Peru (in collaboration with Oscar Rodriguez, Nicolas Pazos, Mateo Majluf and Alejandro Gonzalez), it is entirely open source which, in addition to underpinning the crucial transparency of the endeavor, means that it can easily be replicated and adapted to other countries and political contexts.
