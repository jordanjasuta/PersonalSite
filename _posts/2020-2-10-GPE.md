# Georreferenced Program Evaluation (GPE)

Project led by urbanist data scientist [Antonio Vasquez Brust](https://bitsandbricks.github.io/), and described in detail in the IDB's blog [Behind the scenes: Big Data analysis for public policy](https://blogs.iadb.org/ciudades-sostenibles/en/behind-the-scenes-big-data-analysis-for-public-policy/) (also available in [Spanish](https://blogs.iadb.org/ciudades-sostenibles/es/lo-que-no-ves-de-un-analisis-de-big-data-para-politicas-publicas/)).

The GPE (Georeferenced Program Evaluation) R package includes functions that will allow the user to study various aspects of consumer or beneficiary behavior, including:

* Georeference postal addresses (converting street name and number to latitude and longitude points)

* Obtain base maps of any city’s urban grid and visualize overlaid projections of the distance traveled (between participants’ homes and points of service accessed, for example)

* Estimate a matrix of distances between sites accessed and consumer/beneficiary origin

* Calculate metrics of frequency, distribution by group, and distance travelled by consumers/beneficiaries to points of sale/access

* Create visualizations that explore the difference between frequency and type of consumption by consumer/beneficiary attribute (depending on the information available: socioeconomic status, length of program participation, type of program participation, etc)

Full code, description and installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/EL-BID/GPE).
