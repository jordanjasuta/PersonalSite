# DC Crime Visualization App

This app was created for the George Washington University to visualize crime data in Washington, DC using [Metropolitan Police data](https://mpdc.dc.gov/page/statistics-and-data) for the first three quarters of 2017.

Full code, description and installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/EL-BID/idb-omk-pilot).
