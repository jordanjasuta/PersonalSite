# DATUM: Datos Abiertos de Transporte Urbano y Movilidad

This regional platform gathers past experiences, lessons learned, and open-source tools used to serve as a central source of information on urban mobility community mapping projects in Latin America and the Caribbean. Building on the initiatives already carried out in the region, [DATUM acts as a guide](https://blogs.iadb.org/ciudades-sostenibles/es/datum-datos-abiertos-de-transporte-urbano-y-movilidad/) for collecting, processing, and publicizing urban mobility data. Those wishing to replicate a mapping project in their own city can visit [datum.la](https://datum.la/) to access a central cache of information on community mapping projects in the region.

To inaugurate the platform, DATUM's consortium of partners supported a [pilot mapping in Santiago de los Caballeros](https://blogs.iadb.org/ciudades-sostenibles/en/datum-open-transit-mapping-dominican-republic-santiago-caballeros/), Dominican Republic. Historically, Santiagueros didnâ€™t have standardized information about public transportation routes. After the DATUM pilot was implemented, Santiago de los Caballeros became the first city in the Caribbean where Google Maps can now provide public transport information. 

You can find case studies, resources, and more at [datum.la](https://datum.la).
