# Housing Deficit Estimation

This tool applies a decisive methodology to determine levels of quantitative, qualitative, and total housing deficit based on census data, using census data as an example.

In data-scarce environments reliable nation-wide data on housing conditions might only be available once a decade. To overcome this, the repo contains an additional script that will use night lights data extracted from satellite images in order to now-cast the housing deficit in years where no census data is available. More information on the methodology can be found in the [Housing Deficit Methodology and Guide](https://github.com/EL-BID/Housing_Deficit/blob/master/Housing%20Deficit%20-%20Methodology%20and%20Guide.pdf).

Full code, description and installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/EL-BID/Housing_Deficit).
