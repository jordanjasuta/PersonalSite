# Open Urban Planning Toolbox

The Open Urban Planning Toolbox is a set of open-source tools to support the urban development planning process, from early design through implementation and evaluation of projects. Tools are regularly added (I collected, documented, and promoted the first 6 tools)

The methods and functions of the tools are mixed; Some use techniques such as machine learning as well as crowdsourced data. Finally, considering the importance of “ground-truthing” or field verification of the data and the understanding of urban challenges at the neighborhood and home level, we have also adapted a digital system of data collection in the field to guarantee information faster and spatially accurate.
